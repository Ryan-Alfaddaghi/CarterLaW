            <h5>Thomas S. Carter</h5>
            <p>
                A native of the Inland Empire, Tom Carter has the personal pleasure of serving his home community and the legal needs of its citizens, businesses and institutions.  Tom has been an attorney since 2008 and began his career at the Law Offices of Ronald T. Vera in Claremont, California.   Prior to his current work, Tom provides "Of Counsel" representation for the Law Offices of Vera & Barbosa in Claremont, which represents local businesses, educational institutions, municipalities and nonprofits in a variety of legal matters.  Mr. Carter is a member of the California Bar, the Washington State Bar, and the District of Columbia Bar.
                Tom has selected a team that practices primarily on business matters and civil litigation.  In addition to his time spent managing his own law firm, Tom serves as the General Counsel to NationalLink, Inc., a leading national independent ATM Company based out of Glendora, California.  In this role as General Counsel to a fast paced, growing national company, he has been exposed to a great variety of matters from contract disputes and portfolio purchases to employee issues and regulatory requirements.  With his gained experiences and business acumen, Tom can effectively handle the duties of an "in-house" company attorney for any business.
